# Sign-language to text and speech convertor
# Introduction
Sign language is an essential tool for the deaf and dumb community to communicate effectively with the world. To enhance this communication, I developed a real-time Sign Language to Text and Speech Converter. This project leverages OpenCV and advanced machine learning techniques, primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Random Forest classifiers. The system captures human gestures via a camera and identifies hand landmarks using MediaPipe, which employs CNNs. The data is then trained and tested using Random Forest classifiers. The recognized gestures are first converted to text, which is subsequently transformed into speech using pyttsx3. This innovative solution aims to bridge communication gaps and facilitate seamless interaction for individuals with hearing and speech impairments.

The result of the project is
